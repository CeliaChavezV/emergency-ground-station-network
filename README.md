# Ground Station Network for Emergency Communications

## üåç Project Overview
A web-based platform for managing and documenting emergency communications through a global network of verified ground stations. This system creates a centralized registry of transmitted/received files across participating stations while maintaining strict authentication protocols for operators.
It allows verified operators to document all transmissions and receptions with timestamps, frequency data, and file attachments, while implementing strict authentication protocols to ensure only legitimate ground stations can participate. The system serves as a digital logbook for emergency satellite communications, featuring hardware validation, end-to-end encryption, and multi-level access controls to maintain data integrity and prevent unauthorized access, ultimately creating a reliable global network for crisis response communications.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Secure Ground Station Registry**  
  Verified operator authentication with station validation
- **File Management System**  
  Chronological logging of all transmitted/received files per station
- **Frequency Band Documentation**  
  Automatic recording of transmission parameters (frequency, timestamp, data type)
- **Multi-role Access Control**  
  Tiered permissions for: station operators, emergency responders, and network admins


## üîê Security Protocols
1. **Station Operator Verification**
   - Hardware fingerprint validation
   - Manual credential review by network admins
   - Two-factor authentication

2. **Data Integrity Measures**
   - SHA-256 checksums for all uploaded files
   - Immutable transmission logs
   - End-to-end encryption for sensitive data

## üåü Benefits for Operators
- Contribute to global emergency response infrastructure
- Access aggregated communication patterns
- Receive technical support for station setup
- Participate in standardized emergency protocols
