# Ground Station Network for Emergency Communications

## 🌍 Project Overview
A web-based platform for managing and documenting emergency communications through a global network of verified ground stations. This system creates a centralized registry of transmitted/received files across participating stations while maintaining strict authentication protocols for operators.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Secure Ground Station Registry**  
  Verified operator authentication with station validation
- **File Management System**  
  Chronological logging of all transmitted/received files per station
- **Frequency Band Documentation**  
  Automatic recording of transmission parameters (frequency, timestamp, data type)
- **Multi-role Access Control**  
  Tiered permissions for: station operators, emergency responders, and network admins


## 🔐 Security Protocols
1. **Station Operator Verification**
   - Hardware fingerprint validation
   - Manual credential review by network admins
   - Two-factor authentication

2. **Data Integrity Measures**
   - SHA-256 checksums for all uploaded files
   - Immutable transmission logs
   - End-to-end encryption for sensitive data

## 🌟 Benefits for Operators
- Contribute to global emergency response infrastructure
- Access aggregated communication patterns
- Receive technical support for station setup
- Participate in standardized emergency protocols
